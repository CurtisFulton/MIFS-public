# MEX Integration Framework System (MIFS)

MIFS is an in progress framework for developing integrations to and from MEX.

It allows for Scheduling jobs based on [Cron Schedules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), and accepting HTTP Requests.

# Status

Project is in the early stages of development. I recently started a restructure but had to moved onto other tasks at work so it's still in the middle of a restructure.

It should compile, but the only working sample is the Xero Integration. 

Currently the reverse proxy feature is not working as that was the main part of the refactor.
